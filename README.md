# Knowledge Base
Getting code up and running online can be tricky sometimes, especially if you got no server admin envolved. I'm logging here what I've learned by experience and searching about CentOS 7 to get my code up and running.
These are my personal Cheat Sheets, so I don't have to search around every time.
1. [Laravel Application Deployment on CentOS 7 Server](/laravel-deployment-on-CentOS7.md)
2. [Linux Utilities](/linux-utilities.md)
3. [Controlling Ports](/controlling-ports.md)
4. [User Management](/user-management.md)
